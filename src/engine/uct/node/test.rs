// 1. The root node has to be set up correctly so that the children
//    have a uct value that is not NaN (plays == 1).
// 2. Make sure that terminal nodes are "played", i.e. either a win or
//    a loss is reported and the wins are recorded in the tree.
// 3. Check if siblings of a terminal node will ever be explored
//    (check the uct value of a terminal node)
// 4. Maybe use the root node's plays and wins to keep track of the
//    number of playouts and the average win rate.
// 5. The game probably doesn't need to be stored in the nodes.
//    Keeping a list of moves and passing those to the playout is
//    probably more efficient. BUT using the current code this means
//    that we don't check for super ko violations in the tree!
// 6. Add a test to make sure that the children of the root node don't
//    violate the super ko rule.
// 7. Test the resigning support
// 8. Make sure everything works fine in the game tree when there are
//    no moves to simulate anymore.
// 9. Implement multi threading
